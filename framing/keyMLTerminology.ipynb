    "\n",
    "## Labels\n",
    "Labels are what we are predicting. What the output would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "A feature is the input variable used to predit the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "There are 2 types of examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labeled examples\n",
    "A labeled example would be individual emails that users have explicitly marked as spam or not spam\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unlabeled examples\n",
    "Unlabeled examples contain the feature not the label. In other words, they contain the input but don't contain the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "A Model defines the relationship between features & Labels. There are 2 phases of a models life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "Meaning creating or learning the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "Meaning applying the trained model to unlabeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression vs. Classification\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "A regression model predicts continous values. For example, regression models make predictions that answer questions like the following:\n",
    "* What is the value of a house in California?\n",
    "* What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "A classification model predicts discrete values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:\n",
    "* Is a given email message a spam or not spam?\n",
    "* Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?"
