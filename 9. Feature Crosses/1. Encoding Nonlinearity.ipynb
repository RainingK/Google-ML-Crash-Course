    "# Encoding Nonlinearity\n",
    "## In Figures 1 and 2, imagine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The blue dots represent sick trees.\n",
    "* The orange dots represent healthy trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Images/Feature Crosses - Nonlinearity.png\" alt=\"Nonlinearity\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you draw a line that neatly separates the sick trees from the healthy trees? Sure. This is a linear problem. The line won't be perfect. A sick tree or two might be on the \"healthy\" side, but your line will be a good predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Images/Feature Crosses - Encoding Nonlinearity.png\" alt=\"Encoding Nonlinearity\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you draw a single straight line that neatly separates the sick trees from the healthy trees? No, you can't. This is a nonlinear problem. Any line you draw will be a poor predictor of tree health.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Images/Feature Crosses - Encoding Nonlinearity 2.png\" alt=\"Encoding Nonlinearity 2\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the nonlinear problem shown in Figure 2, create a feature cross. A feature cross is a synthetic feature that encodes nonlinearity in the feature space by multiplying two or more input features together. (The term cross comes from cross product.) Let's create a feature cross named x3 by crossing x2 and x1:\n",
    "\n",
    "x3 = x1x2\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat this newly minted x3 feature cross just like any other feature. The linear formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear algorithm can learn a weight for w3 just as it would for w1 and w3. In other words, although w3 encodes nonlinear information, you donâ€™t need to change how the linear model trains to determine the value of w3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kinds of feature crosses\n",
    "We can create many different kinds of feature crosses. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [A X B]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of two features.\n",
    "* [A x B x C x D x E]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of five features.\n",
    "* [A x A]: a feature cross formed by squaring a single feature.\n"
